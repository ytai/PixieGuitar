Validation:
V Test H/W SPI for display w/ modified pins.
V Test guitar & vbat analog in.
V Prove analog concept with PTG.
V Power enable.
V Prove power up concept.
V Power good.
V IMU.
V Encoder.

Implementation:
- Fix VBAT reading when audio sampling is off.
- Filter SoC.
- Translate acceleration readings to tilt angles.
- Bucket frequencies into notes.
- Flip screen on tilt.
- Watchdog.
- Power off / watchdog reset on long click.
- Power off on low battery.
- Runtime stats inaccurate (result in more than 100%). Also, they overflow.
- Clean-up FreeRTOS port (including interrupt macros).
  Context switching IRQ must be fully implemented in ASM and call a user C
  function. Otherwise, the compiler might possibly do funny stuff with the frame
  pointer. For the time being, it is disabled by a build flag.
- Go over TODOs in the code.
- Add acc reading to demo app.
- Widgets for app GUI.
- Apps:
  - Rainbow: add control of speed and intensity from GUI.
  - Fireworks: N channels, at every tick the peak in the spectrum can override
    the weakest if it is stronger than it. The frequency determines the channel
    color and amplitude the initial brightness. The other channels fade
    exponentially (maybe also in saturation). Then each channel is randomly
    assigned to an LED (different
    one every tick). Tilt creates a flash.
    Can choose the color scheme, the flash color, intensity, fade time,
    bucketing type (octave folding).
  - Trains: 2-3 go in circles around at different speeds, maybe changing color
    over time. Audio volume affects speed.

? Fit to parent / fit to children sizing
? Application stack.
? Replace font?
? Avoid spinlocks in LCD driver.
? OnReset() method to Widget.

V Use DMA for SPI.
V Expose screen brightness API.
V Console UART spin-locks. Use IRQ.
V Same for I2C.
V Instrument runtime.
V Get rid of printing functions in FreeRTOS (configUSE_STATS_FORMATTING_FUNCTIONS).
V Clean-up LCD driver (function names, more elegant init).
V Avoid explicit instance pointers in class structures.
V LCD driver is horrible. Rewrite.
V Generic "Widget App"?
V Centralized title bar handling.

Document:
- Use of DMA.
- Use of PTG.
- Use of QEI.
- FreeRTOS port.
- PRNG using the CRC module.
