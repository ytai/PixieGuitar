Validation:
V Test H/W SPI for display w/ modified pins.
V Test guitar & vbat analog in.
V Prove analog concept with PTG.
V Power enable.
V Prove power up concept.
V Power good.
V IMU.
V Encoder.

Implementation:
V LCD driver is horrible. Rewrite.
V Use DMA for SPI.
V Expose screen brightness API.
V Console UART spin-locks. Use IRQ.
V Same for I2C.
- Replace font?
- Go over TODOs in the code.
V Instrument runtime.
V Get rid of printing functions in FreeRTOS (configUSE_STATS_FORMATTING_FUNCTIONS).
- Watchdog.
- Avoid spinlocks in LCD driver.
V Clean-up LCD driver (function names, more elegant init).
- Runtime stats inaccurate (result in more than 100%). Also, they overflow.
- Clean-up FreeRTOS port (including interrupt macros).
- Context switching IRQ must be fully implemented in ASM and call a user C
  function. Otherwise, the compiler might possibly do funny stuff with the frame
  pointer. For the time being, it is disabled by a build flag.

Document:
- Use of DMA.
- Use of PTG.
- Use of QEI.
- FreeRTOS port.
